# Highrise Integration

This integration is designed to integrate Wombat with the
[Highrise](https://highrisehq.com) CRM. All transactions related to the
storefront will be available for view in Highrise. This is a one-way
integration. Data on Highrise will not sync back to the storefront.

This is a fully hosted and supported integration for use with the [Wombat](http://wombat.co)
product. With this integration you can perform the following functions:

* Send orders to Highrise as Deals
* Order line items, adjustments and payments goes to Highrise as Deals notes
* Send customers to Highrise as People

[Wombat](http://wombat.co) allows you to connect to your own custom integrations.
Feel free to modify the source code and host your own version of the integration
or better yet, help to make the official integration better by submitting a pull request!
